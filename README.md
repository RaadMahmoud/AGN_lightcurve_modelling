# AGN Lightcurve Extraction and Modelling

In this (work in progress) repo we will extract and model the UV lightcurve of AGN including NGC 4151 and Ark 120 using the model of Mahmoud & Done (2019; there applied to the lower Eddington rate NGC 4151), which built upon Gardner & Done (2017; which modelled NGC 5548).

The main ipynb files consist of two sections.

The first is the data extraction, interpolation and rebinning, while the second is the physical modelling phase.
Both sections are present for NGC 4151 while only section 1 is public for ARK 120 at the moment. Apologies for the sparse commenting as this is ongoing, but please don't hesitate to direct any questions to ra'ad.d.mahmoud@durham.ac.uk.

If the ipynb files decide not to load here in github (as they seem to do on all sorts of Jupyter Notebooks apparently at random, cheers GitHub), either try refreshing it a few (hundred) times, or try these links instead:
