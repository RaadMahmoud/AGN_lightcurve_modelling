# AGN Lightcurve Extraction and Modelling

In this (work in progress) repo we will extract and model the UV lightcurve of AGN including NGC 4151 and Ark 120 using the model of Mahmoud & Done (2019; there applied to the lower Eddington rate NGC 4151), which built upon Gardner & Done (2017; which modelled NGC 5548).

The main ipynb files consist of two sections The first is the data extraction, interpolation and rebinning, while the second is the physical modelling phase.

If the ipynb files decide not to load here in github (as they seem to want to do on all sorts of Jupyter Notebooks apparently at random), try these links instead:
