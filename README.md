# AGN Lightcurve Extraction and Modelling

In this repo we will extract and model the UV lightcurve of AGN including NGC 4151 and Ark 120 using the model of Mahmoud & Done (2019; there applied to the lower Eddington rate NGC 4151), which built upon Gardner & Done (2017; which modelled NGC 5548).

The main ipynb files consist of two sections.

The first is the data extraction, interpolation and rebinning, while the second is the physical modelling phase.
Both sections are present for NGC 4151. Please don't hesitate to direct any questions to mahmoud.raad@yahoo.co.uk

If the ipynb files decide not to load here in github (as they seem to do on all sorts of Jupyter Notebooks apparently at random, cheers GitHub), either try refreshing it a few (hundred) times, or try these links instead:

[2023 retrospective: 
Oof, spaghetti code galore! Object orienting this is certainly on my list, but this is overwhelmed by work obligations at Kromek right now. Please be aware I am even more horrified than you by the quantity of repeated code in this tutorial, and instead take it for what it was: physics research code for a physics research audience (read: bodge-programmers!)]
